# About

I'm not usually someone to share a lot about themselves on the internet, but I'll let it slide here

I'm Mercy, a mostly self-taught developer who enjoys every aspect of the internet. Well, maybe not the content, but you get the idea. I play tennis IRL, and though I may not be the best, I certainly may be the worst. (lol.) I also enjoy literature, as well as creative writing. Most of my books end up being discarded into the heap of other half-finished monstrosities, but a few make it through. Who knows, maybe I'll post some of them here.
